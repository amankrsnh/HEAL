# QuickCheck

Created at DubHacks with Sara Habib and Rishi Menon. :)

## Inspiration

Looking up symptoms on web browsers often gives scary and inaccurate results. We wanted to create a platform where users can have a better and accurate preliminary diagnosis.

## What it does

QuickCheck is an online symptom checker that provides a preliminary diagnosis based on the symptoms inputted by the user, from the comfort of their homes.

## How we built it

We coded it using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and used an API (https://apimedic.com/) to receive the required medical information.

## Challenges we ran into

Finding the proper API that gives the required information.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Making the website! Within less than 22 hours we built a minimum viable product that has the potential to be a useful contribution to society.

## What we learned

Making API calls using fetch in JavaScript.

## What's next for QuickCheck

Integrating the google maps API to find the nearest hospitals and clinics to the user.
